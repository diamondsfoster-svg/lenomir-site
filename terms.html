    <h1>Terms of Use – Lenomir</h1>
    <div class="meta">Last updated: 27 November 2025</div>

    <p>
      These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Lenomir mobile application and
      related services (collectively, the “App”), provided by Lenomir Labs (“we”, “us”, “our”).
    </p>
    <p>
      By downloading, accessing, or using Lenomir, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What Lenomir is</h2>
    <p>
      Lenomir is a wellness and self-support app designed to help you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Track mood, energy, lifestyle, and body rhythm</li>
      <li>Reflect through journaling and saved insights</li>
      <li>Use restoration tools such as grounding, bilateral focus, and self-compassion exercises</li>
      <li>(Optionally) receive AI-based reflections and insights (“Vela” or similar features)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Lenomir is intended to support self-awareness and emotional regulation, not to provide
      professional care.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Not medical or crisis service</h2>
    <p>Lenomir:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is not a medical device</li>
      <li>Does not provide diagnosis or treatment</li>
      <li>Is not therapy or a substitute for a qualified mental health professional</li>
      <li>Is not an emergency or crisis service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you are in crisis, feel unsafe, or think you may harm yourself or someone else,
      you must stop using the App and contact local emergency services or a crisis hotline immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you have
      regarding your mental or physical health.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>To use Lenomir, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be legally able to enter into a binding agreement in your country, and</li>
      <li>
        Be at or above the minimum age of digital consent in your jurisdiction
        (for example, 16 in many EU countries), unless you have appropriate
        parental/guardian consent.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Lenomir is not intended for young children. If we later offer a dedicated children’s
      or caregiver version, it will have separate terms.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Your use of the App</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to use Lenomir only for lawful, personal, non-commercial purposes and in
      accordance with these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the App in any way that violates applicable law</li>
      <li>
        Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to access the source code, except where
        permitted by law
      </li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the App, servers, or networks</li>
      <li>Use the App to harass, abuse, or harm yourself or others</li>
      <li>Attempt to bypass any security or access controls</li>
      <li>
        Use the App to create a competing product that copies substantial parts of our
        content, flows, or design
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to limit or suspend your access to the App if we reasonably
      believe you are violating these Terms or misusing the service.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your content</h2>
    <p>
      Lenomir allows you to enter and store content such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tracker entries</li>
      <li>Journal entries and reflections</li>
      <li>Notes, affirmations, or other text you write</li>
      <li>Information submitted to AI features for reflections</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You remain the owner of the personal content you create in the App.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using Lenomir, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
      license to process your content only as needed to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Operate and provide the App</li>
      <li>Generate optional AI-based reflections or insights when requested</li>
      <li>Maintain security and integrity of the service</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations, if required</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not claim ownership of your journals or trackers, and we do not sell your
      personal wellness content.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for ensuring that any content you enter does not violate the
      rights of others, including privacy, confidentiality, or intellectual property rights.
    </p>

    <h2>6. AI features</h2>
    <p>
      Some features in Lenomir use AI to generate reflections or suggestions. When you use
      these features:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Certain text or summary information you choose may be sent securely to third-party
        AI providers
      </li>
      <li>
        Responses may not always be accurate, complete, or appropriate for your unique situation
      </li>
      <li>
        AI outputs are for supportive reflection only, not for medical, legal, or professional advice
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You are responsible for how you use or act on AI-generated reflections. You should not
      rely on AI insights for decisions about safety, medical treatment, or other high-risk situations.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can choose not to use AI features and may control some AI-related settings in the App.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your privacy is important to us. Our Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we
      use it, and your rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using the App, you also agree to our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      The App, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Design, layout, and user interface</li>
      <li>Text, content, flows, and prompts (excluding your personal entries)</li>
      <li>Logos, graphics, icons, and visual styles</li>
      <li>Software code and underlying technology</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      is owned by the creator of Lenomir and/or its licensors and is protected by copyright,
      trademark, and other applicable laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are granted a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license
      to use the App in accordance with these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or create derivative works of the App or its
      content, except as allowed by law or with our prior written consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lenomir” and any related brand elements (including logos and visual identity) are used as
      trade names and brand identifiers for this App. All other trademarks are the property of
      their respective owners.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Subscriptions and payments (if applicable)</h2>
    <p>
      Some current or future features of Lenomir may be offered as paid subscriptions or one-time
      purchases through app stores or other payment providers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Prices, billing periods, and renewal terms will be shown clearly before you purchase.</li>
      <li>
        Payments and refunds for in-app purchases are generally handled by the app store
        (such as Apple App Store or Google Play), and their terms may apply.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are responsible for managing your subscription (for example, canceling before renewal)
        through your app store account or as instructed in the App.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you do not pay necessary fees, we may suspend or limit access to paid features.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are currently using a free or beta version of Lenomir, some sections of this clause
      may not yet apply, but may become relevant when paid features are introduced.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      Lenomir may link to or integrate with third-party services (for example, AI providers,
      analytics, crash reporting, or app stores).
    </p>
    <p>We are not responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The content, policies, or practices of third-party services</li>
      <li>Any damage or loss arising from your use of third-party services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You should review the terms and privacy policies of any third-party service you use.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranties of any
      kind, whether express or implied.
    </p>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we do not make any warranties that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free</li>
      <li>The App will meet your expectations or specific needs</li>
      <li>
        Any content or advice (including AI outputs) will be accurate, complete, or appropriate
        for your situation
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You use Lenomir at your own discretion and risk. You are solely responsible for any decisions
      or actions you take based on information or tools provided by the App.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions do not allow certain disclaimers, so parts of this section may not apply to you.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, Lenomir Labs and its officers, employees, contractors,
      and partners will not be liable for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages</li>
      <li>Any loss of data, loss of profits, or loss of goodwill</li>
      <li>
        Any damages arising out of or in connection with your use of, or inability to use, the App
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In all cases where liability cannot be excluded, our total liability to you for any claims
      arising from or related to the App will be limited to the amount you paid (if any) for using
      the App in the twelve (12) months prior to the event giving rise to the claim, or the minimum
      amount required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations of certain liabilities, so parts of this section
      may not apply to you.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Indemnity</h2>
    <p>
      Where allowed by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Lenomir Labs and its affiliates,
      officers, employees, and partners from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and
      expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in any way connected with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your use of the App</li>
      <li>Your violation of these Terms</li>
      <li>Your violation of any third-party rights</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>14. Changes to the App and Terms</h2>
    <p>We may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add, modify, or remove features of the App</li>
      <li>Update these Terms from time to time</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When we make material changes to the Terms, we will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Update the “Last updated” date at the top, and</li>
      <li>
        Where appropriate, notify you in the App or via other reasonable means
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you continue to use the App after changes take effect, you are considered to have accepted
      the updated Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the App.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Suspension or termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App, with or without notice, if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We reasonably believe you have violated these Terms</li>
      <li>We need to do so for security, legal, or operational reasons</li>
      <li>We discontinue the App</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You may also stop using the App at any time (for example, by uninstalling it).
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after termination, certain sections of these Terms will continue to apply, including those
      on intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and dispute terms.
    </p>

    <h2>16. Governing law and disputes</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms (and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with them)
      are governed by the laws of the State of Hawaii, United States, without regard to
      conflict-of-laws principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the App will be subject to the
      non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Honolulu, Hawaii, unless
      otherwise required by mandatory law in your country of residence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are a consumer in the EU/EEA/UK, you may have certain rights to bring claims in your
      local courts under applicable consumer protection laws.
