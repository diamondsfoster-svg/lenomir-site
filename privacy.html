    <h1>Privacy Policy – Lenomir</h1>
    <div class="meta">Last updated: 27 November 2025</div>

    <p>
      Lenomir is created by Lenomir Labs (“we”, “us”, “our”). We respect your privacy
      and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains
      how we collect, use, store, and protect information when you use the Lenomir
      mobile application and related services (collectively, the “App”).
    </p>

    <p>
      By using Lenomir, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
    <p><strong>Data Controller:</strong><br />
      Lenomir Labs<br />
      Email: <a href="mailto:support@lenomirlabs.com">support@lenomirlabs.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how we handle your data,
      you can contact us at the email above.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Lenomir is (and is not)</h2>
    <p>
      Lenomir is a wellness and self-support app. It provides tools for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Daily trackers (mood, energy, lifestyle, body rhythm)</li>
      <li>Journaling and reflections</li>
      <li>Restoration tools (such as grounding, bilateral focus, and self-compassion practices)</li>
      <li>Optional AI-based reflections and insights (“Vela” or similar features)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Lenomir does not provide medical diagnosis, treatment, or emergency services and is
      not a replacement for professional mental health or medical care.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to collect only the information needed to provide and improve the App.
      The types of information we may collect include:
    </p>

    <h2>3.1 Information you provide directly</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Tracker entries:</strong> daily check-ins such as mood, energy levels,
        lifestyle factors, body rhythm and period-related information (if you choose
        to use these features).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Journal entries and reflections:</strong> text that you write inside the App
        (for example, notes, reflections, prompts).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Restoration and module activity:</strong> which sessions or modules you open and
        complete (for example, bilateral focus or self-compassion exercises).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>AI input:</strong> text you choose to send to AI features (for example,
        when requesting a reflection or insight).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3.2 Device and usage information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Basic device information (such as device model, operating system version,
        language settings).
      </li>
      <li>
        App usage information (such as which screens you visit, feature usage,
        timestamps), primarily for performance, debugging, and improving the user experience.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not intentionally collect precise location data unless you explicitly provide
      it (for example, in a journal entry).
    </p>

    <h2>3.3 Account information (if added in the future)</h2>
    <p>
      If we later introduce optional accounts or syncing, we may collect:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email address or username</li>
      <li>Basic profile settings</li>
      <li>Cloud backup or sync data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any such changes will be updated in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>4. How your data is stored</h2>
    <p>
      Lenomir is designed to be offline-friendly and to keep most of your information
      on your device.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Many entries, such as trackers and journals, are stored locally on your device
        using secure storage mechanisms like app storage or encrypted preferences
        where supported.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you uninstall the App, locally stored data will normally be removed from
        your device.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If we ever use secure cloud storage or remote servers to provide specific features
      (such as syncing or backups), we will explain this clearly in this Policy and
      inside the App.
    </p>

    <h2>5. How we use your information</h2>
    <p>We may use your information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain the App and its features (trackers, journals, restoration tools).</li>
      <li>Offer you insights or trends over time (for example, showing patterns in your trackers).</li>
      <li>
        Power optional AI features, such as Vela insights that reflect back gentle
        patterns or “next steps”.
      </li>
      <li>Improve the App’s performance, stability, and user experience.</li>
      <li>Respond to your support requests and feedback.</li>
      <li>Maintain the security of the App and detect misuse or technical issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not use your personal wellness data to build advertising profiles,
      and we do not sell your personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>6. AI features and third-party processors</h2>
    <p>
      Some optional features in Lenomir use AI services to generate reflections
      or insights based on the information you provide.
    </p>
    <p>When you use these features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Certain text you select or type (for example, recent tracker summaries or
        a journal snippet) may be securely sent to a trusted third-party AI provider
        so the feature can work.
      </li>
      <li>
        We aim to minimize what is sent—only what is necessary to produce the
        requested reflection or insight.
      </li>
      <li>
        We do not sell your AI-related data or use it for independent advertising purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Third-party AI providers process your data on our behalf in accordance with
      data protection laws and under data processing agreements where required.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can choose not to use AI features at any time. In Settings, you may find options such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Turning AI reflections on or off</li>
      <li>Controlling whether your past entries may be used to generate patterns or summaries</li>
      <li>Resetting any locally stored AI insights</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Legal bases for processing (for users in the EU/EEA/UK)</h2>
    <p>
      If you are located in the EU, EEA, or UK, we process your personal data
      under one or more of the following legal bases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Consent:</strong> for certain optional features, such as AI reflections,
        notifications, or sensitive data you choose to enter (for example, period-related information).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> to provide the App and its core
        functionality that you have requested.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> to maintain and improve the App, protect
        security, prevent misuse, and understand aggregated usage patterns—balanced
        against your rights and expectations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Compliance with legal obligations:</strong> where necessary to comply
        with applicable law or lawful requests.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can withdraw your consent for certain processing at any time via Settings
      or by contacting us.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide the App and its features</li>
      <li>Fulfil the purposes described in this Policy</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes, where applicable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In many cases, your data is stored only on your device and remains there until
      you delete it or reset the App.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where we process data on servers (for example, logs or AI requests), we seek
      to keep it for the minimum period necessary for security, troubleshooting,
      and service improvement, after which it may be anonymized or deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Sharing your information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data.</p>
    <p>We may share information only with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Service providers / processors:</strong> such as cloud hosting,
        AI providers, analytics or crash reporting tools, who help us operate and
        improve the App. These parties are required to handle your data securely
        and only according to our instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal or safety reasons:</strong> if required by law, or if we reasonably
        believe it is necessary to protect the rights, safety, or property of you,
        us, or others.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If Lenomir Labs is involved in a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction,
      we may transfer your data to the relevant successor entity, subject to applicable
      law and continued protection of your privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>10. International data transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Because we may use service providers located in other countries, your data may
      be processed in jurisdictions outside of your own, including countries that may
      have different data protection laws than your country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where required by law (for example under the GDPR), we will ensure that
      appropriate safeguards are in place for international transfers, such as
      standard contractual clauses or equivalent measures.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Your rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location and applicable law (for example, under the GDPR),
      you may have rights over your personal data, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The right to access your personal data</li>
      <li>The right to correct inaccurate or incomplete data</li>
      <li>The right to delete your data (“right to be forgotten”)</li>
      <li>The right to restrict or object to certain processing</li>
      <li>The right to data portability (in some cases)</li>
      <li>The right to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can exercise many of these rights directly in the App (for example, by
      clearing data in Settings). You can also contact us at
      <a href="mailto:support@lenomirlabs.com">support@lenomirlabs.com</a>
      to make a request. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Lenomir is intended for adults and older teenagers who can consent to using
      wellness tools under the laws of their country. It is not directed to children
      under the age where parental consent is required (for example, under 16 in many EU countries).
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not knowingly collect personal data from children who cannot lawfully
      consent on their own. If you believe a child has provided us with personal
      data without appropriate consent, please contact us so we can delete it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we later introduce a separate version of Lenomir specifically for children
      and caregivers, it will have its own tailored privacy terms.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data
      against loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. However, no app or online
      service can guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
    <p>You can support your own privacy by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using device-level security (such as a passcode or biometric lock)</li>
      <li>Not sharing your device with others without proper permissions</li>
      <li>Keeping your operating system and the App up to date</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>14. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the
      App, legal requirements, or privacy practices.
    </p>
    <p>When we make significant changes, we will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Update the “Last updated” date at the top</li>
      <li>Where appropriate, notify you in the App (for example, via a notice or prompt)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your continued use of the App after changes are published means you accept
      the updated Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions, concerns, or requests about this Privacy Policy or your
      personal data, you can contact us at:
